    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>about 2 cups elbow macaroni or any pasta shape of your choice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk (whole milk for creamier sauce)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheese (such as cheddar, mozzarella, or a blend)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the macaroni according to the package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and whisk constantly for about 1-2 minutes to create a roux, until it becomes golden brown and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking continuously to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes, while continuing to whisk.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and gradually add the shredded cheese to the sauce, stirring until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Season the cheese sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until well combined and the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
        <li>If desired, transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish, sprinkle with breadcrumbs for a crispy topping, and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 15-20 minutes until golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade mac and cheese!</li>
    </ol>
